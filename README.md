CS-465 Full Stack Development with MEAN

This was a very engaging first project, which has opened me up far more to the prospect of web development in the future.
While HTML remained the most frustrating element in the project, using the various client-side angular modules and focusing on understanding the overall architecture more than the front-end code itself was very helpful for both my understanding and engagement with the project.
